# JS-exercises
Create a new repository on your GitHub. This will your repo for JS exercises.<br>
Do each of the following exercises in a separate file, and upload them to your repo on GitHub.<br>
Create a commit for each exercise (if you want you can add more commits for your convenience).<br>
Submit the link to your repository when you're done.<br>
Write a piece of code that computes the sum of digits of a 3-digit number. You can use the template below:<br>
const num = 123<br>
let sum = 0<br>
// your code goes here<br>
console.log(sum)<br>
Test your code on several different 3-digit numbers (for example 666, 300, 725). Hint: you might need to use Math.floor...<br>
Write a piece of code that finds the solutions for a quadratic equation. You can use the following template:<br>
const a = 1; b = -6; c = 9;  // stands for x**2 - 6*x + 9 = 0<br>
let solutionA = solutionB = 0<br>
// your code goes here<br>
console.log(solutionA, solutionB)<br>
You can find on Google the formula to find the solutions. Test your code on different a, b, c values (like 1, 5, 6 or 1, -1, -1)<br>
Write a piece of code that calculates the absolute value of a given number,<br>
WITHOUT using Math.abs (though you still can use other Math methods).<br>
const num = -8<br>
let absolute;<br>
// your code goes here<br>
console.log(absolute)<br>
Test your code on positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero.<br>
You can run your code using the devtools console, or you can install the Quokka extension for VS Code, or any other method that works for you.
